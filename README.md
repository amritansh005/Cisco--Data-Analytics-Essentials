# Cisco--Data-Analytics-Essentials

I earned this badge by successfully completing the Data Analytics Essentials course through Cisco. This means I have a broad understanding of how the data analytics process creates value from data. I can explain the characteristics of data, including formats, availability, and methods to acquire it. I can also transform data and analyze it using basic statistical and data preparation techniques. I've completed hands-on activities using Excel, SQL, Tableau, and other tools.
